s.description      = <<-DESC
SNPNetwork is a Swift-based HTTP networking library for iOS. It provides an interface on top of Alamofire
that simplifies a number of common networking tasks. We've created it to add some features we needed in Snapp
application which is not supported directly in Alamofire. Another key feature is a super-simplified JSON parsing
facility that gives you clearer syntax by set it's 'responseKey' parameter.
